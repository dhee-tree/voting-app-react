# Best Teacher Website | React Version for <a href="https://github.com/dhee-tree/best-teacher">best-teacher</a>
###### By Students, For Teachers

This is a website created by the second year Lv 3 IT students of Peterborough College (Grad. 2022)

## Background to Project
At the beginning of my Level 3 first year, we had an induction which included a virtual tour. The tour showed us exciting works, images from other departments, but none from ours. This raised questions, curiosity and a desire to have images from our department on that tour.

## Purpose
A website created by Level 3 IT students of Peterborough College (Grad. 2022), to collect student votes for the ***Best Teacher*** award to an IT lecturer.

## Plan
To achieve the goal we are relying on contribution and time investment from students, resource help from teachers.

The project would be developed and deployed using *online IDE* **Replit** and **GitHub**. Both platforms provide remote access, team collaboration, version control, testing capabilities, web hosting and more.

Website to have five pages; home, code, voting, success vote and results page. See [Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14LhrWhSP0YzBVImPPuFdOkEAGBql6S2qNHC6fDzZq_k/edit?usp=sharing), [Wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/bH6OJ6EQKpY06QkakktooN/College-Voting?node-id=0%3A1)

## Requirements 
- Unique code generated for students.
- Student access voting website.
- Unique code verified.
- The student chooses a teacher to vote for.
- The student receives confirmation of the recorded vote.
- Anyone can check the results.

## Considerations
- Student votes must be accurately recorded.
- Votes must be anonymous.
- A student can only vote once.
- The home page could have a countdown to the result day.
- Requires a domain.
- Use the college logo and colour.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
